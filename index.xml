      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-project&#34;&gt;About The Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I found out about system emulation, I have been super fascinated with it. I&amp;rsquo;m building this CHIP-8 emulator (interpreter&amp;hellip;?) to get started since the EmuDev community tends to suggest it for first-timers. So what is the CHIP-8? The CHIP-8 is an abstract machine (not unlike the JVM) that was first used to play games on the COSMAC VIP in the 1970s. I thought while considering this project, &amp;ldquo;Why not implement an abstract virtual machine by using the implementation of a different abstract virtual machine?&amp;rdquo;, and thus, this project came to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t used Java extensively, and this project hardly made me an expert, but I have become much more familiar the language as a result of undertaking this project. There were some pretty complex parts to making this emulator, the most challenging of which had to do with the Event dispatch thread and the opcode 0xFX0A. Anyone familiar enough with the CHIP-8 to recognize opcodes probably sees where this is going: any time the CPU interpreted 0xFX0A, it paused the thread, which meant that input couldn&amp;rsquo;t be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opcode 0xFX0A is pretty simple. It tells the CPU &amp;ldquo;hey, why don&amp;rsquo;t you &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; until a key is pressed?&amp;rdquo;. This becomes a problem in a single threaded application since continuous calls of &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; end up blocking IO, so the program is never able to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; when a key is pressed. So in plainspeak, an infitite loop. I ended up fixing the issue by dispatching UI/IO events on the &lt;code&gt;Event Dispatch Thread&lt;/code&gt; provided by swing, while running other logic on a separate thread. This was a pretty nice solution, but I do wish I would&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time planning the implementation before jumping right into the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the feature list!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough Debug UI (panels to monitor registers, stack, timers, program counter, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable CPU clock speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause/Resume/Reset Emulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load ROMs from file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
