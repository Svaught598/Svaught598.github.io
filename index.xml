      <title>The Maximum Subarray Problem</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem is a classic. Or so I&amp;rsquo;m told. The maximum subarray problem is involves finding the maximum sum out of all contiguous subarrays. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those problems that seems straightforward, and then boom - complicated edge cases seemingly appear from the heavens to say &amp;ldquo;Not so fast!&amp;rdquo;. But that&amp;rsquo;s the essence of algorithm problems, right? They assess a developer&amp;rsquo;s ability to see beyond the scope of some given test cases and construct a robust solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given an integer array &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt;, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Input:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;[-2, 1,-3, 4,-1, 2, 1,-5, 4]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;[ 4,-1, 2, 1]&lt;/code&gt; has the largest sum of 6.
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-first-solution&#34;&gt;A First Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this looks like a great problem to use prefix sums, right? You can iterate over the array and keep track of the minimum and maximum prefix sums you&amp;rsquo;ve encountered, and then &lt;code&gt;max_prefix - min_prefix&lt;/code&gt; will give you the largest sum! Just look at the prefix sum array for our example below:
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prefix Sum Array:&lt;code&gt;[-2,-1,-4, 0,-1, 1, 2,-3, 2]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our answer is simply &lt;code&gt;2-(-4)=6&lt;/code&gt;. This works because the difference in two prefix sums gives you the sum of all elements between where &lt;code&gt;max_prefix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;min_prefix&lt;/code&gt; are located. Straightforward. time to code it up..
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-so-fast&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not so fast!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably already found the fault in my reasoning, but I was not so lucky to see the issue until I had written code. There are some cases that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if the list is only one element? Then &lt;code&gt;max_prefix&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;min_prefix&lt;/code&gt; are the same, so you get a return of 0. This isn&amp;rsquo;t correct!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suppose you have an array &lt;code&gt;[-2, 1,-3, 4,-1, 2, 1,-5,-9]&lt;/code&gt;. Now the &lt;code&gt;min_prefix&lt;/code&gt; occurs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the &lt;code&gt;max_prefix&lt;/code&gt;! Obviously the answer is the same as in the given example, so this is incorrect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the motive behind algorithm questions - can you handle the ambiguity? Programming a solution to a problem only works when the problem is &lt;em&gt;well-defined&lt;/em&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s usually up to the developer to define what the scope is. If our given array was guaranteed to have at least two elements along with &lt;code&gt;min_prefix&lt;/code&gt; occuring before &lt;code&gt;max_prefix&lt;/code&gt;, then this solution would be ideal! Unfortunately, this is not the case for the problem on Leetcode: My original solution failed for the second edge case listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution-to-our-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution to our &amp;ldquo;Solution&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But alas, there is hope! The simple solution is two use a conditional to filter the first edge case, and use the current &lt;code&gt;prefix_sum&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;max_prefix&lt;/code&gt;. Because the current &lt;code&gt;prefix_sum&lt;/code&gt; is always ahead of &lt;code&gt;min_prefix&lt;/code&gt; we never have to deal with the second edge case. At each point in the iteration we take the max of two values: the current &lt;code&gt;result&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;prefix_sum - min_prefix&lt;/code&gt;. If the current prefix sum is lower than the minimum prefix sum encountered, we update &lt;code&gt;min_prefix&lt;/code&gt;. Now we can implement a solution using prefix sums! Before we do so, it helps to go ahead and write down all the contraints for the problem, just so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with any more unexpected edge cases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;input array &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; is always at least one element long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, not many constraints! This is &lt;em&gt;the reason&lt;/em&gt; problem is unecesarily tricky; It is very easy to underestimate the complexity of open-ended problems. Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s the implementation using prefix sums:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        Finds maximum sum of all contiguous subarrays
        using prefix sums!

        input:
            `nums`: array of integers
        
        returns:
            `result`: integer
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        # edge case, list is one element long
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        
        # Initialize variables
        min_prefix = 0
        prefix_sum = 0
        result = -float(inf)
        
        # compute prefix sum, find sum of subarray, update min_prefix
        for num in nums:
            prefix_sum += num
            result = max(result, prefix_sum - min_prefix)
            min_prefix = min(min_prefix, prefix_sum)
            
        return result
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-second-solution&#34;&gt;A Second Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now entering Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm. I&amp;rsquo;m don&amp;rsquo;t have a formal background in Computer Science, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the benefit of already being exposed to Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm upon first encountering &amp;ldquo;The Maximum Subarray Problem&amp;rdquo;. The way Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm works is actually very similar to the prefix sum method, and while it performs about the same, the code looks much cleaner. It works by keeping track of sums as you iterate through the array (&lt;em&gt;go figure&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider iterating through the list manually with a working subarray, trying to find the max subarray. Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm says you have two options at each step:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ditch your current working subarray and start a new working subarray array with the next element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your current working subarray and add append the next element to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrased like this, all we have left is to figure out how to decide between these choices. Because the problem is concerned with the maximum &lt;em&gt;sum&lt;/em&gt; of all subarrays, all we need to do is check to see if the next element will make our sum larger than it already is. If our current sum is larger, we stick with option 1, and if our would-be sum is larger, we go with option 2. The real beauty of this solution is that you can implement it in such a way that the edge cases are taken care of without any additional logic! Such an implementation might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        Finds maximum sum of all contiguous subarrays
        using Kadane&#39;s Algorithm

        input:
            `nums`: array of integers
        
        returns:
            `max(nums)`: integer
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        # start at second element 
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):

            # increase the local sum if next number increases it
            if nums[i-1]+nums[i] &amp;gt; nums[i]:
                nums[i] = nums[i-1]+nums[i]

            # otherwise, start new local sum
            else:
                nums[i] = nums[i]

        # Return the max of all local max subarray sums
        return max(nums)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is purposefully lengthy to draw a comparison to the options above. Making it short and sweet, we get a very eloquent solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        Finds maximum sum of all contiguous subarrays
        using Kadane&#39;s Algorithm

        input:
            `nums`: array of integers
        
        returns:
            `max(nums)`: integer
        &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            nums[i] = max(nums[i-1]+nums[i], nums[i])
        return max(nums)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any algorithm problem, there are trade-offs to the solutions. Because of what I can only assume is overhead in accessing Python lists by indices, Kadane&amp;rsquo;s algorithm is actually &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than the solution using prefix sums. This totally shocked me, but the difference is only 20ms by Leetcode&amp;rsquo;s measurement, so there probably isn&amp;rsquo;t much difference. The implementations of Kadane&amp;rsquo;s modifies the &lt;code&gt;nums&lt;/code&gt; array, but since Python is weird, new items are created on the heap and the pointers are modified to point to the new elements. In a statically typed language, Kadane&amp;rsquo;s would beat out Prefix Sums in terms of memory, but they still rank the same in runtime complexity (that is &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-project&#34;&gt;About The Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markov Chains are simple stochastic models that predict the future state of a system using only the current state. Despite being very naive models, you can effectively use them to generate &lt;em&gt;fake sentences&lt;/em&gt; by building them from a corpus of actual sentences. Consider the following collection of sentences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am very scared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate spiders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spiders are very creepy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Markov Chain model constructed from this corpus might look a bit like:
&lt;img src=&#34;example.png&#34; alt=&#34;example image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where each node represents a word in a sentence, and the numbers are relative weights (or probabilites) for words that follow. You can increase the accuracy of these models by adding to the corpus, or increasing the amount of words used to predict the next word (e.g. (&amp;lsquo;I&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;am&amp;rsquo;) &amp;mdash;&amp;gt; &amp;lsquo;very&amp;rsquo;). Other tooling exists in the Python ecosystem that can be joined with this method to improve sentence generation further (
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nltk/nltk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NLTK&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this project to learn more about web-development while playing around with this concept.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CHIP-8 Emulator</title>
      <link>/project/chip8/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/chip8/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-project&#34;&gt;About The Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I found out about system emulation, I have been super fascinated with it. I&amp;rsquo;m building this CHIP-8 emulator (interpreter&amp;hellip;?) to get started since the EmuDev community tends to suggest it for first-timers. So what is the CHIP-8? The CHIP-8 is an abstract machine (not unlike the JVM) that was first used to play games on the COSMAC VIP in the 1970s. I thought while considering this project, &amp;ldquo;Why not implement an abstract virtual machine by using the implementation of a different abstract virtual machine?&amp;rdquo;, and thus, this project came to be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough Debug UI (panels to monitor registers, stack, timers, program counter, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save/Load from savestates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable CPU clock speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause/Resume/Reset Emulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load ROMs from file or from list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;problems&#34;&gt;Problems&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t used Java extensively, and this project hardly made me an expert, but I have become much more familiar with the language as a result. There were some pretty complex parts to making this emulator, the most challenging of which had to do with the Event dispatch thread and the opcode 0xFX0A. Anyone familiar enough with the CHIP-8 to recognize opcodes might see where this is going: any time the CPU interpreted 0xFX0A, it paused the thread, which meant that input couldn&amp;rsquo;t be read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opcode 0xFX0A is pretty simple. At least, my implementation is. It tells the CPU &amp;ldquo;hey, why don&amp;rsquo;t you &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; until a key is pressed?&amp;rdquo;. This becomes a problem in a single threaded application since continuous calls of &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; end up blocking IO, so the program is never able to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; when a key is pressed. So in plainspeak, an infitite loop. I ended up fixing the issue by dispatching UI/IO events on the &lt;code&gt;Event Dispatch Thread&lt;/code&gt; provided by swing, while running other logic on a separate thread. This was a pretty nice solution, but I do wish I would&amp;rsquo;ve spent more time planning the implementation before jumping right into the code. This brings us to the biggest thing I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-importance-of-planning&#34;&gt;The Importance of Planning&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Physics graduate (now aspiring developer) I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the proper training in computer science fundamentals and best practices for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This isn&amp;rsquo;t to say I suck (I mean, I could be better), but that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what to consider while building this application. This lack of planning - in a Java project, mind you - resulted in a mess of everything being public. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge issue for this small project, but in a larger project it could manifest as having pieces of code that are insanely complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say there is a method in CPU called &lt;code&gt;initializeMemory()&lt;/code&gt; that does the heavy lifting of setting the memory, register, timers, etc&amp;hellip; all to 0. Now we make the method public and call it from the CPU constructor upon startup AND call it from the GUI panel anytime someone presses &lt;strong&gt;reset&lt;/strong&gt;. Seems like a win-win. Some time passes, and it is decided that the current implementation of &lt;strong&gt;reset&lt;/strong&gt; is not what is needed; the application actually needs to preserve some memory upon resetting the system! now there are two options, neither of which are super enticing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expose a &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; method in CPU called &lt;code&gt;reset()&lt;/code&gt;. If the CPU and GUI panel are the only objects using &lt;code&gt;initializeMemory()&lt;/code&gt;, great! That means this was caught early, and the code isn&amp;rsquo;t all tangly and gross. But imagine every single one of your test cases calls &lt;code&gt;initializeMemory()&lt;/code&gt;. We can&amp;rsquo;t just make the old method private, or we can&amp;rsquo;t run the tests! Now there are two public methods that are confusingly similar. This branches into a subdecision of &lt;strong&gt;refactoring tests&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;deal with ambiguity&lt;/strong&gt;. The former makes the code maintainable but takes a lot longer and the second is a quick fix that makes additional changes more complex, but a little bit of planning would have circumvented this entire fiasco. Needless to say, I have become acquainted with the concept of technical debt. Oh yeah, and option two&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lied, sorry. The two options are really just one option in a trenchcoat that will either mug you or make you balance their checkbook. Just do things right and plan next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Infection Simulation</title>
      <link>/project/infection/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-project&#34;&gt;About The Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the projects I did during my Computational Physics course at Texas A&amp;amp;M University-Commerce. The programming and physics were a ton of fun! &amp;hellip;learning the syntax for gnuplot wasn&amp;rsquo;t. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick example for the terribly unintuitive syntax (and yes, the repeated colons are necessary):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot infile using 2:xtic(1) every :::1::1 t &amp;quot;Healthy&amp;quot; lc rgb &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, \
         &#39;&#39; using 3 every :::1::1 t &amp;quot;Infected&amp;quot; lc rgb &amp;quot;dark-green&amp;quot;, \
         &#39;&#39; using 4 every :::1::1 t &amp;quot;Recovered&amp;quot; lc rgb &amp;quot;dark-yellow&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;effectiveness-of-social-distancing&#34;&gt;Effectiveness of Social Distancing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I incorporated a parameter to set a certain amount of the population to stay still to kind of simulate &lt;em&gt;social distancing&lt;/em&gt;. The idea was that we should be able to get an idea for how effective social distancing is when it comes to slowing the spread of a contagion. It turns out it is pretty effective! I don&amp;rsquo;t have the results in the Github link, but I believe it came out to be that 30% of the population was social distancing, the rate of infection was halved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;problems&#34;&gt;Problems&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, the bulk of the problems I had with this project revolved around using this plotting software. The learning curve is comparable to the base of a cliff; it was impossibly complex at first and all at once became straightforward and simple. I actually prefer gnuplot over the more popular matplotlib after this project since the software is so flexible with plotting data. If there are any academics reading this, I implore you: learn how to use this software. It made a lot of things - normally complex in Python/Matplotlib - very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have one minor problem unrelated to Gnuplot: 10 seconds of simulation took 10 minutes to prepare. This really wasn&amp;rsquo;t a huge issue, but I liked having instant feeback when I made changes to the project, so I took a profiler to my code and found that the biggest bottleneck was with IO. Apparently opening and closing files takes a lot of time. News to me. I circumvented this by storing all the data in one file, using &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; as a delimeter to differentiate between clusters of particles at different timesteps, but alas, the program still took 8 minutes to prepare 10 seconds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profiler now said that the bottleneck was invoking a subprocess with gnuplot. I realized that plotting any constiuent timestep was an orthogonal task to all others. This meant that I could call all &lt;code&gt;plot(timestep)&lt;/code&gt; in parallel with each other and not worry about complicated stuff like race conditions. Implementing it was super easy, but it also meant that I had to start storing data for timesteps in separate files to keep things thread safe (probably didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know gnuplot well enough to come up with a better solution). It also meant that each plotting task would require it&amp;rsquo;s own instance of Gnuplot, so there was a very real chance it would remain slow, or worse: &lt;em&gt;become even slower&lt;/em&gt;. I made the changes, and got a speed increase of X10! Now, rendering 10 seconds of simulation was just short of a minute!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-work&#34;&gt;Future Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might pick this project up again in the future since there is so much room for expansion. Things could be made much quicker by using CUDA and drawing with OpenGL instead of plotting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-the-project&#34;&gt;About The Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than writing small scripts to perform very specific tasks, this was my first real programming project. I had some difficulties finding applications to make solutions for my research (most applications do not perform the calculations that I needed), so I decided to make my own. I would commonly spend 30-40 minutes just doing calculations, then more time doing them again just to ensure that they were correct. It was during this project that I realized that I truly loved software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;problems&#34;&gt;Problems&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the biggest problem I had starting out is a problem I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even dream of having today. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how to organize packages and functions to make the code &lt;code&gt;modular&lt;/code&gt;. I spent about a month messing around with a broken pile of conditionals and magic values, and eventually gave up. The project wasn&amp;rsquo;t even functional, and my database was a crappy JSON file. Did I mention that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what a class was? I thought, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Maybe this whole software thing isn&amp;rsquo;t right for me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time passed, and I stumbled upon the idea of architecture in code. For as long as I pursued this project, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t looked into reading about programming practices at all, so the fact that there are agreed upon codebase structures really shocked me. I read more about Object-Oriented Programming, and became familiar with some of the software design patterns commonly used. I quickly decided to refactor the entire codebase using an MVC architecture. After some time, adding features became super easy! The project went from being painfully unmaintainable to functional and even organized. I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are a lot of areas that could be designed better, but just making the change to modular code made such a huge difference that I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure what those areas might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other major challenge was handling dependencies. I used Python and the Kivy framework to build this project, but switched dev machines halfway through. This resulted in a new installation of Kivy that was different from the prior one. I had no idea at the time, and never implemented unit tests, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t catch the issue until I had already built on top of the new API. I ended up with an application that was built with two incompatible versions of Kivy, that was able to be run on &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; platforms. I fixed it &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt;. Needless to say, I understood the value of unit testing and dependency management after this absolute fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;
