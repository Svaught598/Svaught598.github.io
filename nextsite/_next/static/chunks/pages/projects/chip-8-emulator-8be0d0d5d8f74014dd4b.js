The CHIP-8 emulator is the 'Hello World!' of emulation development, and writing the code to get pong running showed me sooooo much about how computers work at a lower level. Unlike many systems, the CHIP-8 is actually an abstract machine (not unlike a language interpreter) that is capable of fetching & executing opcodes and manipulating data stored in memory. Here's what really shocked me: the opcodes are just bytes! the data is just bytes! IT'S ALL BYTES!"),Object(i.a)("p",null,"So yeah, I was bewildered. Not sure what I expected, but the elegance of interpretting chunks of data in different contexts really surprised me.

There were some pretty complex parts to making this emulator, the most challenging of which had to do with the Event dispatch thread and the opcode 0xFX0A. Anyone familiar enough with the CHIP-8 to recognize opcodes might see where this is going: any time the CPU interpreted 0xFX0A, it paused the thread, which meant that input couldn\u2019t be read."),Object(i.a)("p",null,'Opcode 0xFX0A is pretty simple. At least, my implementation is. It tells the CPU \u201chey, why don\u2019t you sleep() until a key is pressed?". This becomes a problem in a single threaded application since continuous calls of sleep() end up blocking IO, so the program is never able to tell when a key is pressed. So in plainspeak, an infitite loop. I ended up fixing the issue by dispatching UI/IO events on the Event Dispatch Thread provided by swing, while running other logic on a separate thread. This was a pretty nice solution, but I do wish I would\u2019ve spent more time planning the implementation before jumping right into the code.

Now we make the method public and call it from the CPU constructor upon startup AND call it from the GUI panel anytime someone presses reset. Seems like a win-win.

If the CPU and GUI panel are the only objects using initializeMemory(), great! That means this was caught early, and the code isn\u2019t all tangly and gross. But imagine every single one of your test cases calls initializeMemory(). We can\u2019t just make the old method private, or we can\u2019t run the tests! Now there are two public methods that are confusingly similar. This branches into a subdecision of refactoring tests or deal with ambiguity. The former makes the code maintainable but takes a lot longer and the second is a quick fix that makes additional changes more complex, but a little bit of planning would have circumvented this entire fiasco.
